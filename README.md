# .NET WebAssembly Test

### [Demo here](https://dustinsoftware.github.io/dotnet-wasm/index.html)

### What is this thing?

It demonstrates .NET code with a thin interop layer between the Javascript and the Mono runtime. It's based off of the work of [lrz/mono-wasm](https://github.com/lrz/mono-wasm/tree/4290b5b786a7f2625d38e31056da7ed9139fe431).
